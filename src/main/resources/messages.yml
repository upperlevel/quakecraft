# In this file is stored almost every message in the plugin
# The main purpose for this is to change the messages that the players will see, so the setup-section could be removed
# in the future (and it does NOT contain every command present in the plugin)
#
# Every message here is a list of messages, but you can also put only one line writing "name: message"
# This uses the default bukkit colors (http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/support/server-support/tutorials-and-faqs/1940467-bukkit-colour-codes)
# But some custom tools are added to make the messages easier to create:
# If you use the character "^" at the beginning of the line the custom tools will be activated:
# "^|text" will center the text in the chat
# "^>text" will make the text aligned to the left
# "^<text" will make the text aligned to the right (aka. does nothing)
# "^^Text" will act as a plain ^ (the printed text would be "^text"
# While if you put a color code in front of the ^ character it will create a separator
# For example:
# message:
# - '^a'
# - '^>Right'
# - '^|Centered'
# - '^<Left'
# - '^a'
# Would create a center inside two aqua separators with tre lines, the first aligned to the right, the second centered
# And the last one will remain to the left
# If you don't want any message to be displayed you can simply put an empty array [] in the message (ex. message: [])
